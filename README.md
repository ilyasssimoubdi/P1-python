# Titanic Data Exploration
Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover key insights about passenger demographics and survival rates. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), we explore various factors that influenced survival, such as class, age, and gender.

Key Questions

How did passenger class impact survival rates?

Did age play a significant role in survival?

Were there gender disparities in survival chances?

What insights can we extract from embarkation locations?

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis


How to Run the Project

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib jupyter

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:

jupyter notebook notebooks/Titanic_Exploration.ipynb

Key Insights

First-class passengers had a higher survival rate than third-class passengers.

Women and children were more likely to survive than men.

Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg had slightly higher survival rates.
